## 🧩 About Me

I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** with **10+ years of experience** delivering enterprise-grade solutions across **.NET, Python, Go, Node.js, and modern front-end frameworks**.  

I design, build, and scale **cloud-native platforms** on **Azure, AWS, and GCP** — bringing together microservices, event-driven systems, DevOps automation, and intelligent features powered by **AI/ML and LLM-based search**.  

My engineering philosophy is simple:  
> “Write clean, observable, and scalable code that drives measurable business impact.”

I thrive at the intersection of **architecture, automation, and innovation** — mentoring teams, leading migrations, and modernizing legacy systems into resilient cloud ecosystems.
